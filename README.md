## Pipeline Research
A webpage containing research comparing a real-life CPU pipeline architecture like RISC with MARIE architecture taught in college for educational purposes alone. 

## Prerequisites
#### What is RISC
<b>R</b>educed 
<b>I</b>nstruction 
<b>S</b>et 
</b>C</b>omputer 
- is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly-optimized set of instructions rather than the highly-specialized set of instructions typically found in other architectures.

#### What is MARIE
MARIE ('Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy') is a machine architecture and
assembly language served only for educational purposes from The Essentials of Computer
Organization and Architecture (Linda Null, Julia Lobur).
